Cognito - Auth
===

by *Guzmán Monné*.

This repo contains all the code for the article "[Custom authentication using AWS Cognito](https://medium.com/@gmonne/custom-authentication-using-aws-cognito-e0b489badc3f)", hosted on [Medium](https://www.medium.com).

Before running this code you should create a JavaScript file inside the `javascript` folder called `config.js`. Here you should set your "User Pool" id and app client id on the window object using the names: `USER_POOL_ID`, and `CLIENT_ID`.

Here are some useful links used while creating the article:
